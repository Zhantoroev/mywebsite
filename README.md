    Hello, all! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

I am Syimyk Zhantoroev. Senior DevOps Engineer at Ant Tech.

I assume that I have developed a broad range of skills and abilities throughout the years that make me a skilled, competent, professional and flexible DevOps Engineer. Wherever I end up working, I constantly keep in mind that I can add value to the organization by delivering secure and cutting-edge solutions depending on the demands of the business. I'm enthusiastic about developing professionally. Including my great technical background, I also thrive at decision-making, teamwork, and communication.

In my spare time, I like to create products using Node.js, with Modern Javascript Libraries and frameworks like React.js and Express.js.
